                Ranveer Singh Bhavnani (born 6 July 1985) is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films. He is the
                recipient of several awards, including five Filmfare Awards. He is among the highest-paid Indian actors
                and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list since 2012.

                After graduating from Indiana University Bloomington, Singh made his acting debut with a leading role in
                Yash Raj Films' romantic comedy Band Baaja Baaraat (2010), winning the Filmfare Award for Best Male
                Debut. He gained praise for playing a melancholic thief in the drama Lootera (2013) and established
                himself as a star through his collaborations with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, beginning with Goliyon Ki
                Raasleela Ram-Leela (2013). He portrayed Bajirao I and Alauddin Khilji in Bhansali's period dramas

                Zoya Akhtar's ensemble comedy-drama Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), produced by and cameo-starring her brother
                Farhan Akhtar, featured Singh alongside Anil Kapoor, Shefali Shah and Priyanka Chopra as the younger
                sibling of a dysfunctional Punjabi business family who aspires to become a pilot. Writing for Mumbai
                Mirror, Kunal Guha found Singh to be the "surprise element" of the film; he praised his "immaculate
                comic timing" and took note of his subtlety. Commercially, the film underperformed. He next reunited
                with Bhansali in the period romance Bajirao Mastani (2015), opposite Padukone and Chopra. He portrayed
                Bajirao I, for which he shaved his head and to prepare, he locked himself in a hotel room for 21 days.
                Raja Sen wrote that Singh "brings his character to life and does so with both machismo and grace", and
                commended him for his perfecting his character's gait and accent. The film earned ₹3.5 billion (US$44
                million) to become one of the highest-grossing Indian films, and garnered Singh the Filmfare
                Award for Best Actor.
